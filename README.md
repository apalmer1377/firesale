College market site built to build web development skills

This is a small website I've been working on throughout the summer, in order to build my skills in the web development stack.  Due to the fact that it has both client-side and server-side pages as well as database calls, I assume it would be incredibly difficult to actually view the website on your own computer, but if you find yourself overcome with the urge to see how it looks, I plan on writing an instruction guide as well as bash scripts in order to replicate the local environment.  Cheers!
